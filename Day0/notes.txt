1.Earth
🟢 Step 0: What is Earth?
Earth is the planet we live on. You can think of it like a giant ball made of:

Land – Mountains, deserts, forests, cities, villages

Water – Oceans, rivers, lakes (about 70% of Earth is water!)

Air – A layer of gases called the atmosphere (oxygen, nitrogen, etc.)

Earth is always:

Spinning on its own (one spin = 1 day)

Moving around the Sun (one full circle = 1 year)

You, me, animals, plants, oceans — we all live on this spinning ball.

2.Space
Space is the huge, dark area that begins just above Earth’s sky.
You can think of it like a giant, endless black sea with no air, no sound, and no life — just stars, planets, and floating objects.

✨ Key Points:
Starts ~100 km above Earth
That’s where our atmosphere becomes super thin — airplanes can’t go higher, and that’s where space begins.

No Air or Sound
Space is a vacuum — there’s no oxygen, no wind, and you can’t hear anything.

Very Cold and Very Dark
Since there’s no air to hold heat or scatter light, space is extremely cold and black.

Full of Floating Things
Like:

🌍 Planets (like Earth, Mars)

🌞 Stars (like our Sun)

🛰 Satellites

🪐 Moons, comets, space dust

Imagine blowing up a balloon — Earth is like a small dot inside that giant balloon. The rest is all spac

3.When something goes up into space and keeps circling around a planet (like Earth), it is said to be in an orbit.

🛰 What things orbit Earth?
The Moon – our natural satellite

Satellites – human-made machines (we’ll get there next)

Space stations – like the ISS where astronauts live

4.🟢 Step 2: What is Orbit? (Restarted)
Imagine this:
You are standing on Earth.
You throw a ball straight ahead (not up, not down).

Normally, what happens?

👉 The ball goes forward a bit, then falls to the ground because of gravity.

Now imagine:
You are on a very tall mountain — even above the clouds.

You throw the ball super fast — not just a little throw — you throw it at 28,000 km/h (using a rocket).

What happens now?

👉 The ball still wants to fall down…
👉 But it's going so fast forward that Earth curves away underneath it
👉 So it never hits the ground — it keeps falling around the Earth

This is called orbit:

You’re always falling

But you’re also moving forward so fast that you never hit the ground

So you just keep going in a circle around Earth

5.When we say a satellite is “falling around Earth” — it’s because gravity is pulling it down, but its speed keeps it going forward, so it keeps circling instead of crashing.

6.🟢 Question:
Why does orbit create a circular (or oval) path? Is it because forces are equal and opposite?

✅ Answer:
Yes, but let’s phrase it very precisely.

An object (like a satellite) stays in orbit because two things are happening at the same time:

Force	Direction	Role
Gravity	⬇️ Pulls the satellite toward Earth’s center	Keeps it from flying away
Inertia / Speed	➡️ Keeps the satellite moving forward	Keeps it from falling down

So they are not exactly opposite in direction like a tug-of-war, but they are balanced in a way that makes the object curve around Earth.

⚖️ Not equal-opposite like this:

Edit
⬅️ Force1      ➡️ Force2
(This would cancel out and object stays still)
🌀 But like this (curved path):

Copy
Edit
➡️ Speed → tries to move straight
⬇️ Gravity → pulls inward
🎯 Together → object curves around Earth (orbit)
That’s how a circular (or elliptical) motion happens:

Always falling inwards

But always moving forward fast enough to miss the Earth every second

This principle is actually called:

🧠 Centripetal force = inward pull (gravity)
💨 Tangential velocity = sideways speed

The combination makes the object move in a circle or oval — like a satellite.
